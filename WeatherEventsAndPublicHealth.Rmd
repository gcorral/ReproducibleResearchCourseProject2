Incidence of Severe Weather Events Over Public Health and economic on EEUU
===========================================================================

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and 
economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events 
can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing 
such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks 
characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, 
including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, 
injuries, and property damage.

//When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes 
//both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within 
//the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

//```{r cars}
//summary(cars)
//```

//## Including Plots

//You can also embed plots, for example:

//```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
//plot(pressure)
//```

/Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent 
//printing of the R code that generated the plot.
